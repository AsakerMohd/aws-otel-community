## Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Community!

If you’re an open source observability user or contributor, we invite you to get involved. You can contribute in the following ways:

* Ask a question by filing an issue.
* File a bug by filing a pull request.
* Contribute an enhancement or a feature which you need and maintainers will be happy to code review. You can open an issue to discuss the design of your proposed enhancement and then file a PR.
* If you’re just getting started, we welcome you to get started with issues tagged as “good first issues” and join Gitter to ask maintainers and other developers any questions you may have
* Join the awesome upstream community on the OpenTelemetry project. Participate in the OpenTelemetry SIG meetings where observability experts meet and discuss the OpenTelemetry specification and implementation of observability components. And the code is open source - so contribute to OpenTelemetry!
